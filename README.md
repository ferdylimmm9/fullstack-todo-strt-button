- **Filtering:** Tasks can be filtered by their `status` (pending/completed).
- **Sorting:** Tasks can be sorted by `created_at` date in ascending or descending order.
- **Data Validation with Zod:** All incoming requests are validated using Zod schemas to ensure data integrity.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.

### Frontend Features

- **Token Storage:** Authentication tokens are stored in cookies for session persistence across pages.
- **Virtualized Task List:** The task list is virtualized for performance optimization, especially when displaying large datasets.
- **Infinite Scroll:** Tasks load dynamically as the user scrolls down, reducing the need for pagination.
- **React Query:** Used for efficient data fetching, caching, and network state management.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind is used for component styling to quickly design responsive and visually appealing UI elements.
